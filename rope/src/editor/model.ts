// Editor layers, in draw order (the list also stacks bottom-up in the toolbar):
// `scene` is the level's bodies, `camera` the camera-behaviour volumes and
// `notes` the authoring annotations (invisible in play).
//
// There is deliberately NO decoration layer, and no drawn shape at all: what a
// level LOOKS like is its Blender scene (`LevelData.scene`,
// docs/blender-scenes.md), bound to the bodies here by their `name`. The editor
// authors what the game simulates and lights.
//
// `lights` is the level's own light sources (see `LightData`). It is a layer
// rather than a property of a body because a light is not a piece of stuff: it
// has no collision, no mass and no surface, it is placed where the lamp SHINES
// from rather than where the lamp is, and a shaft coming down through a grate
// has no geometry at all. It is the same argument the camera layer is built on,
// and it earns the same thing - a light is drawn, picked, dragged, rubber-banded,
// duplicated, nudged and undone by exactly the code every wall goes through.
// The editor's layers. `scene` is the level itself - everything that is drawn
// in play and lives in a body - and the other two are authoring furniture.
//
// Geometry and lights used to be two layers, and merging them is the same
// correction as everything else here: a light is not a KIND OF LAYER, it is a
// scene object like a shape, and it belongs to a body exactly as a shape does.
// Two layers made that impossible to see - a lamp's fitting and its light sat on
// different layers, so one could be hidden or locked without the other, and
// welding them into a body meant a cross-layer selection. What distinguishes
// them is `EdItem.object`, which is what the FORMAT distinguishes them by.
//
// `fireflies` holds the FIREFLY PATHS (`FireflyPathData`): routes a swarm
// guides the player along, drawn with the camera path's curve tools but
// belonging to no camera. Editor furniture like the camera layer - nothing on
// it is a body or drawn in play.

// chain end ties to (`AnchorObjectData`). It is an item rather than a pair of
// numbers on the chain for the same reason - a chain end is a thing on a body,

// concave outline is cut into convex pieces by the loader (see "Convex-only
// polygons; compound bodies" in docs/game-design.md and `polyMustBeConvex`
// below, which holds a camera region to the older, stricter rule).
//
// They are NOT kept centred on their centroid. The origin is the placement the
// author gave the shape and a corner edit leaves it alone (see `setPolyVerts`);
// `centreShapeOrigin` puts it on the centroid once, when the shape is drawn, and
// `shapeCentre` is where "and where is its mass" is answered from the outline.
//
// `path` is an OPEN curve, permitted only on the camera layer: a camera path
// (see `CameraPathData`). It is not a degenerate polygon - it has no inside, no
// area and no winding, and its node ORDER is its direction of travel, which is
// the one thing about it that carries meaning. `setPathNodes` is its writer,
// and it leaves the origin alone exactly as a polygon's does; the node average
// is what `centreShapeOrigin` places that origin at when the curve is drawn, a
// curve having no area centroid.
//
// `verts` is the points the route passes through and `handles` the cubic Bézier
// tangents at each, as offsets, ONE PER VERT and kept exactly that long by the
// writer. Two arrays rather than one array of nodes because every shared helper
// here - bounds, hit-testing, the transform, the vertex handles - wants the

// path is.

// exactly as its tangents are, and every renumbering - a deletion, an
