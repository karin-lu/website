// THE EDITOR'S CLIPBOARD, as text.
//
// What is copied is a piece of a LEVEL FILE, in the on-disk pixel form, and it
// is put on the SYSTEM clipboard. That is the whole of the design, and both
// halves are doing work.
//
// The system clipboard is the only thing two browser tabs share without a
// server round trip, and two tabs is the case that matters: an assembly built
// once - a finish gantry, a lamp, a rail rig - has to reach the other
// levels, and until now it could not leave the tab it was built in. The editor
// held three in-memory arrays instead (`clipboard`, `clipboardChains`,
// `clipboardVines`), which a reload emptied and a second tab never saw.
//
// The level format is the payload because it is already the serialisation the
// editor is held to: `toLevelData` is what a SAVE writes, so the round-trip
// cases that hold a save lossless hold a copy lossless, and there is no second
// description of an item to drift from the first. It also means a payload can
// be read - and hand-written - as what it plainly is, a fragment of a level.
//
// WHAT IS NOT IN IT: the player spawn, the level block and the environment.
// None of them is a thing in the level, so none of them is a thing to copy; a
// paste that brought a spawn would move the target level's, which is the one
// edit nobody asked for.
