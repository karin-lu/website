// The Visuals workspace's editor furniture, drawn INTO the 3D scene: the
// gameplay plane's grid, every collision outline, the lights' icons and rings,
// the spawn, the camera regions and paths, the notes, the selected polygon's
// corners and a tool's draft (plans/visuals-workspace.md, "What is drawn").
//
// The Level workspace draws all of this on the 2D overlay, which is exact only
// while the gameplay plane is parallel to the screen; once the camera is free
// the overlay would be drawing on a plane that is no longer there, which is why
// a turned view draws none of it. Drawn in the scene instead, each mark is
// where the thing it describes is, from any angle, and it is picked by the
// same raycast as the models (`Scene3D.pick`) through the guide tag it carries
// (`tags.ts`).
//
// The marks are the overlay's marks, in the overlay's colours (imported, never
// restated): a collision outline in its body's colour or the hook-proof steel
// or the mud ochre, dashed where the overlay dashes it, the selection orange on
// what is selected and the member blue on the pieces of a selected body.
// Collision outlines are drawn with the depth test OFF and after the scene, so
// the collision stays readable through the geometry that dresses it - which is
// what the head-on overlay was for.
//
// Rebuilt when the model's revision, the selection or the layers change
// (`sync`), never per frame; per frame only the pixel-sized parts are resized
// (`update`), in place. The plane grid is kept apart from that rebuild: a drag
// moves the revision every frame, and the grid (up to `GRID_MAX_LINES` lines)
// changes only when the level's extent crosses a whole major cell.
//
// Nothing here needs a DOM: the icons are drawn into `DataTexture`s, and three's
// fat lines (`Line2`) build and raycast in bun, so `cli render3d` counts and
// picks the guides of a model headlessly.
