// Canonical, hand-editable level format — the single source of truth for the
// level schema, shared by the runtime loaders (`Level`, `BallLevel`) and the
// level editor. `levelData.ts` is auto-generated from a Godot scene and stays
// untouched; it is written in the RETIRED flat form below, which
// `normalizeLevelData` folds into this one at load.
//
// Geometry is authored in Godot/scene pixels (as in the generated data); the
// simulation runs in metres. `scaleLevelData(data, PX)` converts on load and
// `scaleLevelData(data, PIXELS_PER_METER)` converts back for saving to disk.
//
// THE SHAPE OF A LEVEL. A level is a list of BODIES, and a body is a list of
// SCENE OBJECTS: a collision shape, a light source, or a chain anchor.
// Everything a body has that is one-per-body — what it collides as, what colour
// it is, how much a current in it pushes — lives on the body; everything a body
// may have several of lives on its objects.
//
// That is a change of shape rather than of vocabulary, and it is worth saying
// what it replaced, because three separate mechanisms collapse into it:
//
// - A compound body was a `group` STRING TAG on several flat entries, matched by
//   name at load. Now it is what it always meant: one body with several
//   collision objects. Nothing has to agree about a tag, and the properties a
//   body has exactly one of cannot be authored several times and then quietly
//   collapsed onto the first member's (`syncGroupProps` is gone with it).
// - DECORATION was `collision: false` on a body-shaped entry - a shape that had
//   to carry, and then ignore, every physics field. Then it was a body with a
//   geometry object and no collision object. Now it is not in the level at all:
//   what a level LOOKS like is its Blender scene (`scene`, docs/blender-scenes.md)
//   and the level holds what the game simulates and lights.
// - A LIGHT was its own top-level list with no parent, so it could not ride
//   anything, and a lamp was TWO authored objects at the same point that nothing
//   kept in step. That gap was patched by deriving a light from a glowing shape,
//   with seven fields on the visual describing a light in disguise. All of it is
//   gone: a light is an object, it sits in the body its fitting is in, and it
//   rides that body's pose because it is inside it.
//
// UNITS. Lengths are scene pixels on disk and metres in the sim, and
// `scaleLevelData` converts them. Angles, the uniform `scale`, `tileScale` and
// a light's `intensity` are NOT lengths and pass through untouched. Getting that
// wrong is silent: the scalers rebuild objects field by field, so a field they
// do not enumerate is dropped on the next save rather than reported — hence the
// round-trip cases in `cli render3d`, which are what actually hold them to their
// lists.

// Body kinds a level can contain:
// - static:      immovable geometry the rope wraps and bodies collide with.
// - killzone:    an Area2D that resets the level when the avatar enters it.
// - rigid:       a dynamic RigidBody2D (gravity + collisions), authored in place.
// - force:       an Area2D that accelerates every body inside it along the
//                area's own rotation (a river current, wind, an updraft).
// - water:       an Area2D that DRAGS every body inside it toward a current
//                running along the area's own rotation (a sewer channel, a
//                sluice, a falling stream). A force area pushes and has no
//                terminal speed; water has a speed it carries things at, and
//                being slowed to it and being pushed by it are the same act.
//                See `WaterArea`.
// - finish:      an Area2D that FINISHES the level when the avatar enters it -
//                the line at the end of the course (see `FinishLine`,
//                `BallLevel.completedFrame` and docs/levels.md). The mirror of
//                `killzone`, down to the overlap test it is decided by: the
//                same volume, entered, with the opposite meaning.
//
// Hook-only scenery is not among them, and used to be (`anchor`): a body
// nothing but the hook can find is now the `passable` flag below, for the reason
// that retired the `impermeable` kind and one more. A kind is what a body IS, so
// hook-only could only ever be immovable scenery - and the thing levels want it
// for is a background leaf on a sprung stem, which is a `rigid` body. A flag
// composes with every kind; a kind excludes every other.
//
// A TRAMPOLINE is not among them either, for the same reason and with the same
// answer: it is the `bounce`/`launch` pair below, so a pad can be static scenery,
// a bouncy crate that still falls, or a paddle on a bearing that swats what it
// hits, rather than one of the three at the cost of the other two.
//
// Hook-proof (`impermeable`) is deliberately NOT among them - it is a per-object
// flag below. It was a kind while it could only ever be static scene geometry,
// and that cost the two things a level actually wants: a hook-proof crate that
// still falls and is hauled about (nothing can be `rigid` and `impermeable` at
// once when both are kinds), and a compound wall with one attachable ledge and
// hook-proof faces everywhere else.
//
// A body with NO collision object has no physics at all, so its kind is not
// consulted. It is still written (and defaults to `static`), because a shape may
// be switched back and forth while a level is authored and silently losing the
// kind on the way through would be a field that forgets.

  // `rot` is an angle OFFSET in radians from the pose the body was drawn at, so

// origin is its centre of mass everywhere in the engine, so where the outline
// sits in its own frame is the editor's business and not the sim's. A rect stays
// its own kind rather than being written as a four-vertex poly: every recorded
// replay was simulated through the rect-specific collision routines.
//
// `curve` is the fourth: a cubic Bezier node list with a WIDTH, which is the
// bar - a rail, a pipe, a handle - that no box or loop of vertices can state
// without an author placing the boxes by hand. It is stroked at load
// (`lib/stroke.ts`) into the convex pieces that tile it, the same way a concave
// polygon is cut into the pieces that tile it, so nothing downstream of the
// build knows it was ever a curve; and a rail's centreline IS its curve rather
// than something derived from a shape's proportions (see `lib/rail.ts`).
//
// Simple and not convex, which is the one place the two halves of the project
// disagree about what a polygon is, and deliberately: the ENGINE's polygon is
// convex without exception (a reflex vertex is unwrappable, see "Convex-only
// polygons; compound bodies" in docs/game-design.md), while a LEVEL authors the
// outline the geometry actually has - an L-shaped ledge, a notched pillar, a
// cave mouth. `makeShapes` cuts a concave outline into the convex pieces that
// tile it as the object is built, so the file keeps the author's shape and the
// solver still only ever sees convex ones. A loop that crosses itself is not a
// shape either way and fails the build.
//
// The exception is a CAMERA REGION, whose polygon must stay convex: a region is
// tested by its face half-planes and grown into a buffer zone by offsetting
// them (`pointInRegion`, `pathOutlineGrown`), neither of which has a concave
// answer, and a region is not built into pieces that could carry one. The editor
// holds a camera-layer polygon convex for that reason.
//
// `belt` is the fifth: a CONVEYOR, a band `thickness` deep wrapped round the
// outside of two or more WHEELS, whose surface runs round the loop
// (`lib/belt.ts`, docs/conveyors.md). Each wheel is a centre in the object's
// frame and the wheel's own radius `r`; the band lies on it, so the running
// surface round wheel i is at `r + thickness`, and the loop is the convex hull
// of those discs, every wheel on it. `wheels[0]` is at (0, 0), the object's own
// origin, so placing the object places the belt (the argument `moveNodes`
// makes for node zero), and is written out anyway because it carries a radius.
// `thickness` is the band's depth IN THE PLANE, a length, > 0. `speed`
// is ONE SIGNED NUMBER - px/s on disk, m/s in the sim - and its sign is the
// direction, as `spinPeriod`'s is: positive turns the loop clockwise on
// screen. It builds one disc per wheel and one thin quad per run, nothing
// between the wheels, on a STATIC body that does not move; anything else fails
// the build.
//
// A belt also carries its BAND's look, because the band is drawn by the game

// and a room lit by it is a room with no inside. The reference look is the

// framing it falling away to black - and every part of that is a light with a
// POSITION and a REACH.
//
// It is an object IN A BODY rather than a top-level list, which is the whole of
// what changed about it: a light in the body its fitting is in rides that body's
// pose, so a lantern welded into a swinging crate swings with its light. A light

// field that converted with the rest would have to convert as the SQUARE of the
// factor. Rather than carry the one field in the file that scales differently

  // field. Clamped to 0..8 Hz at build like the linear spring.

  // one: gravity swings it, the player's weight on the end of it changes the
  // swing, a chain hauls it round and it eventually comes to hang. This one is
  // driven, so nothing in the level can disturb it - the player rides it, hooks
  // it, is swatted by it and shoves it in vain. It is a moving piece of the
  // LEVEL rather than a body under the level's physics, which is exactly what
  // `AnimatableBody2D` is, and what a rhythm the author is timing a jump
  // against has to be.
  //
  // `swingAmp` is the half-amplitude in RADIANS, like `rot` which it is measured
  // from: the body sweeps rot ± swingAmp, so π/6 is a 60° arc. Signed only in
  // the sense that a negative one starts the sweep the other way, which
  // `swingPhase` says better. `swingPeriod` is the seconds of one full there-
  // and-back cycle. `swingPhase` is the offset into that cycle in CYCLES rather
  // than radians, 0..1: a row of pendulums authored at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 is
  // the interleaved rhythm an author wants a quarter turn of the phrase to
  // mean, without anybody dividing by 2π. Absent or a zero amplitude or period
  // = a plain static body, which is every static authored before these fields.
  //
  // None of the three is a length. The amplitude and the phase are angles (one
  // in radians, one in cycles) and the period is a time, so all three cross
  // `scaleLevelData` untouched - the split `pivotFreq` and `drag` already make.

  // What BOUNDS the pair is the contact speed rather than taste: a mover's
  // surface has to cross well under about 2 cm a frame or the character sweep
  // resolves against a surface that has already crossed the avatar, and a
  // pendulum's fastest point is `swingAmp · 2π/swingPeriod · radius` - so a
  // rideable swing is a slow, heavy one, and shortening the beat or lengthening
  // the arm buys travel at exactly that number's expense. The editor's mover
  // panel reads it out live and `cli movers` `levels` measures it on every mover
  // the registry ships.

  //
  //   rot(t) = rot + 2π · (t / spinPeriod + spinPhase)
  //
  // It is the pendulum's sibling and is driven on exactly the same terms:
  // nothing in the level can disturb it, it carries whatever rides it, and its
  // pose is a pure function of the frame. What it is NOT is a `pivot` rigid
  // spun up to speed - that one is a real bearing, so a player landing on it
  // slows it, a chain hauls it round and friction is a torque on it. This one
  // keeps its beat whatever happens to it, which is what a rhythm an author is
  // timing a jump against has to be. It is also what the hand-written
  // `addWindmill` builder always did, offered to a FILE - which is the only way
  // the ball arena can have one, its driver taking no `init` hook.
  //
  // `spinPeriod` is the seconds of one full TURN, and its sign is the direction:
  // 4 turns clockwise on screen every four seconds, -4 the same turn
  // anticlockwise. One field rather than a rate and a direction because a
  // rotor's whole authored motion is one number, and the seconds-per-turn half
  // of the pair is the one that reads next to `swingPeriod` - both are "how long
  // does a cycle take". 0 or absent = a plain static body, which is every static
  // authored before the field.
  //
  // `spinPhase` is where in the turn the body starts, in CYCLES like every other
  // phase here: a pair of blades authored at 0 and 0.5 are the half turn apart
  // an author means, and 0.25 is a quarter turn on from the pose the file drew.
  //
  // Neither is a length - a time and an angle in cycles - so both cross

  // otherwise draw one frame in twenty spinning a whole turn backwards.
  //
  // What BOUNDS it is the contact speed, and harder than it bounds a pendulum:
  // a rotor never slows down, so its fastest point is `2π/|spinPeriod|` times
  // the distance from the bearing to its farthest corner at EVERY instant, and
  // a surface has to cross well under about 2 cm a frame (see `MoverScript`).
  // A 1 m blade is already at the bar on a 5 s turn. The editor's mover panel
  // reads the figure out live and `cli movers` `levels` measures it on every
  // mover the registry ships.

  // Static bodies only: a body that TRAVELS AN AUTHORED ROUTE - a lift, a

  // same way: nothing in the level can disturb it, it carries whatever rides it,
  // and where it is on a given frame is a pure function of the frame number.
  //
  // `moveNodes` is the route, as a cubic Bezier node list in the body's own
  // authored frame (see `MoveNodeData`), and NODE ZERO IS THE BODY - pinned at
  // (0, 0), so a plain shuttle is two nodes and a body with fewer than two is a
  // body that stands where it was drawn. Frame-local rather than in world
  // coordinates so the route rides its body: turning the body turns the route,
  // and moving it in the editor carries the route along with it.
  //
  // `movePath` is the RETIRED form: the waypoints after the first, as a plain
  // polyline with no handles and no keys. `scaleLevelData` folds it into
  // `moveNodes` at the one gate every level passes through - prepending the body
  // as node zero - so a level authored before curves keeps exactly the polyline
  // it authored and nothing downstream reads the field at all.
  //
  // `moveMode` is what the body does at the end of the route (see `MoveMode`):
  // travelled there and back, gone round for ever, or travelled once and
  // teleported back to the start. `moveClosed` is its retired two-valued form
  // and is folded the same way, at the same gate. Absent = `backAndForth`.
  //
  // `moveSpeed` is how fast the body travels, in pixels/s on disk and metres/s
  // once scaled - a SPEED and not a duration, so that lengthening a route makes
  // the trip longer rather than the platform faster, which is what an author
  // means by "this lift moves at half a metre a second". It is the speed
  // everywhere no node keys one (`MoveNodeData.speed`); under an ease it is the
  // AVERAGE over a traverse, since the ease redistributes the same trip time
  // rather than shortening it (so `sine` peaks at π/2 of it) and under `linear`
  // with nothing keyed it is simply the speed. 0 or absent = a body that does
  // not move, which is every static authored before these fields.
  //
  // `movePhase` is where in the trip the body starts, in CYCLES like the
  // pendulum's and for the same reason - a row of lifts at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 is
  // the interleaving an author means. A cycle is one lap of a `loop`, one
  // THERE-AND-BACK of a `backAndForth` (so 0.5 is the far end, which is the
  // useful half to be able to name) and one end-to-end trip of a `repeat`.
  //
  // `moveEase` shapes the speed within a traverse (see `MoveEase`) and belongs
  // to the modes that have ENDS: a `loop` has none to ease at, and easing round
  // a lap would be a body that slows down at an arbitrary point of a circle with
  // nothing there. Absent = `linear`.
  //
  // `moveAlign` turns the body with the route, so a minecart noses up and down a
  // curved track with no keys at all. It is a TURN, measured from the pose the
  // body was drawn at and applied on top of it: the body leaves its drawn angle
  // the way it leaves its drawn position, and a platform drawn flat and sent
  // left travels left rather than arriving upside down (see `moveAngleAt`).
  // `MoveNodeData.rot` adds to it, as a correction to the track rather than a
  // replacement for it.
  //
  // A body may swing AND move, and the three motions compose by addition: the
  // route writes where the body is, the route's alignment and rot keys write
  // which way the track has turned it, and the pendulum writes the swing on top
  // of that - so a bearing on a moving body is a pendulum hung from a travelling

  // An UNDERGROUND level is the reason this is authorable rather than a
