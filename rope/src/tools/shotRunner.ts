// Headless chromium, driven over the DevTools protocol.
//
// It replaces `--screenshot=<file>`, which could only ever answer the question
// "what was on screen when the virtual-time budget ran out" - a guess in both
// directions. Too early is the late-frame blank flake (`shot --3d` returning a
// uniformly empty picture while the 2D path renders the same frame fine); too
// late is six seconds a grab, which in one session was 56 grabs and 25 minutes
// of waiting for a page that had been ready for five of them.
//
// What CDP buys, and each of these was a real cost before it:
//
// - The grab is GATED ON `window.shotReady`, which the page has always set and
//   nothing has ever polled. It fires the moment the page says it is done.
// - The page's console comes back on the same channel (`window.__shotLog`, plus
//   `Runtime.consoleAPICalled` for anything the page-side hook cannot reach), so
//   a screenshot arrives with the diagnostics that explain it.
// - `Page.captureScreenshot` takes a CLIP, and `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`
//   fixes the viewport at exactly the game's 1920x1080 frame. That retires the
//   measured "headless chromium keeps 87px of the window" hack, which never
//   worked: it left an 87px letterbox band along the bottom of every grab.
// - A hung page fails loudly, with its partial log printed, instead of stalling.
//
// No dependency: Bun's own `fetch` and `WebSocket`, and chromium's own protocol.

// the slow one - see "Performance claims need real-GPU numbers" in docs/debugging-rendering.md.

// It is no longer guaranteed to exist, which is why there is a second entry.
// A distribution may ship a chromium whose SwiftShader cannot start (Fedora's
// Chromium 142 is one: `libvk_swiftshader.so` is present and the context is
// refused anyway), and what that looks like from here is every `--3d` grab in
// the project failing at once, on every scene, with a page that never becomes
// ready - which reads as the renderer being broken rather than as the browser
// having no software GL.
//
// ANGLE over the host's EGL is the fallback: it uses whatever GL the machine
// really has, so it is a picture of this machine rather than of SwiftShader.
// That is a fine trade for the thing a grab is usually FOR (does the scene
// draw, is the prop the right way round) and the wrong one for a pixel diff
// across two machines - so the fallback announces itself.
