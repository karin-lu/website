// One file, two kinds of node. A node named like a body is BOUND: lifted out of
// the file and hung under that body's visual root, so it rides the body - a
// rigid crate, a mover, a pivot. Every other node is SCENERY and stays in the
// file's own root, standing in
// the world where Blender placed it. Blender is the author of WHERE everything
// is, in both cases: a bound node is mounted at Blender's pose minus the body's
// rest pose, so at rest it is drawn exactly where Blender put it, and the body
// carries it from there.
//
// The placement (`dressScene`) is a pure function of a loaded object and the
// bodies, so `cli render3d` holds it without a file, a fetch or a GPU.
