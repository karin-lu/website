// `Scene3D` - the WebGL half of the renderer. It owns a renderer, a scene, a
// camera, the lighting, and one visual per body; it consumes exactly the same
// interpolated state the 2D renderer does, and it never touches the sim.
//
// TWO CANVASES, ONE CAMERA. The WebGL canvas sits under the existing 2D one,
// which clears transparent and keeps everything that is genuinely 2D: the debug
// overlay, the aim reticle, the area glyphs, the FPS counter, and in the editor
// the collision outlines and handles. Both are driven from the same `Camera`
// through `space.ts`, so an outline drawn on the top canvas lands pixel-exact on
// the geometry it describes underneath (asserted by `cli render3d`, not eyeballed).
//
// NO MODULE-GLOBAL STATE. Two of these exist at once - the game page and the
// editor - so everything mutable lives on the instance. `playerRig.ts` is the
// anti-pattern this is written against. What IS shared is the material cache in
// `assets.ts`, which is immutable once built and belongs to no scene.

  //
  // - A material's PROGRAM is compiled the first time a mesh wearing it is
  //   drawn inside the frustum. `compile()` over the scene compiles every
  //   material on every object, visible or not, and `compileAsync()` waits for
  //   the driver, in parallel where it can.
  // - The SHADOW PASS wears its own materials: one depth material for spot and
  //   directional lights and one distance material for point lights, which it
  //   reconfigures per caster (side, map, alpha test) and keys per object
  //   (instancing). Each caster variant is therefore a program of its own,
  //   compiled the first time such a caster is inside a shadow camera - the
  //   chain, the first time it is thrown near a lamp. `shadowVariants` builds
  //   one stand-in per variant and compiles them against this scene's lights.
  // - A TEXTURE is uploaded, and its mip chain generated, the first time a
  //   material sampling it is drawn. `initTexture` over every texture the
  //   scene's materials and the water shader sample does it now.
  // - A GEOMETRY's buffers are uploaded the first time it is drawn. One draw
  //   of the whole scene with culling off and nothing hidden does that, and is
  //   also what runs the real shadow pass for every static caster.
  //
  // `session-1697f` is the receipt: a lantern wearing the level's only emissive
  // map scrolled into view 26 s into a run and cost a 15 ms frame plus a 45 ms
  // GPU-process stall (docs/debugging-rendering.md). `cli shot --probe all`
  // is the check that nothing is left: over a whole replay after this has run,
  // the program and texture counts must not move.
  //
  // The link check at the end is the diagnostic half. three reads the link
  // status in `onFirstUse`, from `WebGLProgram.getUniforms()`, so neither
  // `compile()` nor `compileAsync()` reports a failed program; asking each one
  // for its uniforms is what turns the failure into the `console.error` of
