// Blender scenes: the level's dressing, modelled as one `.blend` and exported
// as one GLB (see docs/blender-scenes.md).
//
// A level names its scene once (`LevelData.scene`). Every object in the exported
// file whose name is a body's `name` is that body's look, mounted on the body
// and carried by it; every other object is scenery, standing where Blender put
// it. Collision is never derived from any of this - the file is appearance and
// nothing else, exactly as a geometry object is.
//
// This module is the browser-safe half: where a scene's files live, how a body
// name is matched to a node, the manifest that pins a published scene, and the
// shape of the `meta.json` the exporter writes beside the mesh. Loading and
// mounting are `sceneDressing.ts`; reading `meta.json` off disk (node only) is
// `sceneMeta.ts`, kept apart so no `fs` import reaches the browser bundle.

// dressed, and a content-addressed name per export would leave every draft in
// the release - so the pin is the only thing that says which export a commit
// meant, and `assets:fetch` verifies it. Written by `assets:publish-scenes`

// Someone else's work shipped inside a scene: a texture Blender packed into the
// export. `name` is the image (or set) as the credits list it. Resolved by the
