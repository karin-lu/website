// What a level will download, worked out from the level data alone.
//
// This is the same question `Scene3D.setLevel` answers by BUILDING the scene -
// every geometry object's surface, every prop, the sky, the water maps - asked
// without a canvas, a GPU or a body. It exists because the answer is needed
// before any of that: the preload list inlined into `index.html` (see
// `preloadManifest` in vite.config.ts) is what lets the page start fetching
// 26 MB at first paint instead of after the whole module graph has landed, and
// a build step cannot build a scene.
//
// IT MUST AGREE WITH THE SCENE, and nothing here can prove that it does - the
// two walk the same data by different routes. The guard is at the other end:
// `download.ts` warns in dev whenever a file is asked for that the preload list
// did not name, so drift shows up the first time the level is played rather
// than as a bar that stops at 94%.
//
// Over-naming a file is the cheaper mistake (a wasted download) and under-naming
// it is nearly free too (the app fetches it when it gets there, a beat late), so
// this is deliberately a resolver with no cleverness in it: walk everything,
// resolve each name exactly as the renderer's own `surfaceName` does, and let
// the set do the deduplicating.
