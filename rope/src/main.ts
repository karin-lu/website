// nothing on screen, on a page whose steady-state frame is 1 ms of draw.
//
// SAME CAMERA is the whole of it, and it took three attempts to find. Compiling
// every program in the scene up front cost 278 ms and saved nothing; uploading
// every texture up front saved 80 ms of 450. What was actually happening is that
// the pre-render drew from the camera's INITIAL pose - the origin, because
// `CameraController` had not run yet - so it warmed whatever happened to be at
// the origin, and the first real frame, drawn after the controller had put the
// camera on the avatar, paid the whole cost again for the part of the level that
// is actually on screen. Running the controller first, against the same follow
// point the first frame will use, takes the gap under 100 ms - which is the
// decode of the last file to land, and nothing else.
//
// The warm frame covers the FIRST frame. What it cannot cover is everything
// outside the spawn frustum, which three compiles and uploads on the frame the
// player first scrolls it into view - a lantern 19 m below the spawn cost a
// 15 ms frame and a 45 ms GPU stall 26 s into `session-1697f`. That is what
// `Scene3D.prewarm` pays after the wait, and the load is allowed to take as long
// as it needs: the rule is that nothing is compiled or uploaded on a played
