// The byte store, and the preload list it reads.
//
// TWO THINGS GO INTO THE HEAD OF EVERY PAGE, ahead of anything else:
//
//   1. `src/render3d/store.ts`, compiled and inlined as a plain script. It is
//      what fetches and counts every stored byte, and the app talks to it
//      through `window.__ropeStore` (see render3d/download.ts).
//   2. On `index.html` only, the preload list: which files each level needs and
//      what they weigh, so the store can start fetching before the app exists.
//
// INLINED RATHER THAN IMPORTED because vite merges every module script in a page
// into one entry: loaded as its own `<script type="module" src>` the tag simply
// disappeared and the code came back inside the 1.14 MB shared chunk, which is
// the wait it is supposed to start ahead of. As an inline classic script it runs
// during HTML parsing, so the level's 26 MB is arriving at ~40 ms instead of at
// 240 ms (production) or 1530 ms (dev server, where vite serves 5.2 MB of
// unbundled modules). That gap was the whole of the loading bar's empty second.
//
// The list is resolved HERE, off disk, because it is a fact about the level
// files and the asset manifest and both are on disk: a build step cannot build a
// scene, so `levelStoredFiles` answers the same question by walking the level
// data (see render3d/levelAssets.ts, and the drift warning it describes). A
// file-backed level is re-read per page load, so a level the editor is saving
// stays in step without the server restarting under it (see `levelData`).
//
// `transformIndexHtml` runs in dev serve and in build alike, so the dev server
// and the shipped page carry the same thing. Only `index.html` gets a preload
// list: the editor and `shot.html` build scenes too, but neither is a page
// anybody waits on, and a preload for a level they may not open would be a
// download for nothing.
// A file-backed level's data as it is ON DISK RIGHT NOW, rather than as it was
// when this config was loaded (see `LevelSpec.file`). The dev server does not
// restart on a level write any more - that restart was the editor's autosave
// cycling the server - and it is the one thing that used to keep the preload
// list in step with what the author is editing.
//
// A write is not atomic, so a read can land mid-write and get half a file;
// the compiled-in copy is the answer then, and is at worst as stale as the
