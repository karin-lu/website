"""Export a level's Blender scene as the game's dressing.

    blender -b assets-src/scenes/<scene>.blend --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 \
        --python tools/blender/scene_export.py -- out.glb meta.json [--cache DIR [--stale-occlusion]]

Run by `scripts/scene-export.ts` (`just scene <level>`), which optimises the
result and finishes the meta; see docs/blender-scenes.md.

WHAT GOES OUT. Every object in the scene that has geometry (a mesh, a curve, a
surface, a text, a metaball), except:

- one linked from another file (the level's collision guide is one, linked
  from `<scene>-guide.blend`), or an override of one;
- one in a collection whose name starts with "guide" (any case), or in a
  collection excluded from the view layer (the checkbox in the outliner);
- one hidden in RENDER (the camera icon), itself or through a collection it is
  in. Render visibility is what ships; viewport visibility is the artist's own
  business and is ignored, so a reference hidden to get it out of the way is
  still hidden from the game only if it is hidden from the render.

Lights, cameras, empties, armatures never go out: the level's own lights carry
a budget and semantics glTF cannot (see docs/lighting-and-surfaces.md), and an
empty that parents things is flattened away by the optimiser anyway.

WHAT IS KEPT. Every object's WORLD transform, because that is the whole
binding: the renderer mounts an object named like a body at Blender's pose
minus the body's rest pose and lets the body carry it (render3d/sceneDressing.ts).
Modifiers are applied. Materials go as glTF can carry them - a Principled BSDF
with image textures, a constant tint on one, alpha clipped by a threshold - and
a PROCEDURAL Base Color or Normal (noise, ramps, mixes, bumps: what the
formations' stone is) is baked by Cycles into an image of the exported copy's
own, through a fresh unwrap, and wired back in, so it goes as a
baseColorTexture or normalTexture (`bake_procedural_textures`). Everything else
glTF cannot carry is reported in `warnings`.

Frames: Blender is z-up, the exporter writes y-up (Blender x, y, z -> glTF
x, z, -y), and the game draws in glTF's frame (x right, y up, z toward the
camera). So the gameplay plane is Blender y = 0, toward the camera is Blender
-y, and a backdrop behind the level sits at positive Blender y. The guide the
level exports stands in this frame, so nothing here has to be remembered.

    Only the colour is baked - Cycles' diffuse COLOR pass, no light - so the
    game still lights the surface; a procedural normal (a bump) goes as a
    tangent-space normal map. It works on the export's own copies: each target
    gets a mesh with its modifiers applied and a fresh unwrap (BAKE_UV), its
    materials are copied so each object's point at its own images, and the file
    is never saved. The resolution is formations/render.py's (`bake_size`:
    TEXELS_PER_METRE up to BAKE_SIZE_MAX). With `cache_dir`, an object whose
    prepared mesh and maps are in the bake cache (bake_cache.py) loads them
    instead of being prepared and baked: the key is taken on the scene before
    anything is prepared, so a cached object costs neither its creases'
    rebuild nor its unwrap. With `stale_occlusion`, an object whose
    neighbours alone changed loads its last bake too (bake_cache.Cache), and
    each one is named in `warnings`. Returns how many objects were baked or
    loaded.

    `paints` (moss.texture_paints) are texture-only mosses: a rock one grows
    on has its colour baked whatever its material, and the moss painted into
    the bake (`paint_moss`); a cached map holds its moss, the moss's key
