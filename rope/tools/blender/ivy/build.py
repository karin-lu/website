"""Ivy geometry: a painted mask on a host mesh becomes a carpet of flat ivy
leaves that has grown out from one origin point, every leaf pointing away
from it and lying over the leaf beyond it, and vines of the same leaves hang
from anchors placed on the host by hand. The look is the painted-foliage one
(Genshin, Breath of the Wild, The Witness): every leaf is one flat colour,
shaded by a smooth "hull" normal borrowed from the rock, so the carpet reads
as one soft mass of distinct colour blocks. See rope/docs/blender-ivy.md for
the history of the choices.

Everything here is a pure function of (host mesh, host matrix, stamps, vines,
origin, params) - no bpy state is read or written - so the add-on's live
rebuild and the scene exporter's rebuild produce the same mesh bit for bit.

THE PIPELINE (in world space, metres; the result is returned in the host's
local frame, because the ivy object is parented to the host with an identity
transform):

1. The host's evaluated triangles, welded.
2. The triangles near a stamp, refined by edge bisection to `resolution`.
3. The mask: the stamps composited in painting order, and a lobed threshold.
   The paint is the only thing that decides WHERE ivy grows.
4. The hull normal: the host's vertex normals smoothed over `rounding`, so a
   leaf on a facet shades with the rock's rounded volume, not the facet.
5. The underlay: the painted part of the host, clipped on the iso-line and
   lifted 2 cm, in the leaf colour. Where leaves thin out it is ivy, not rock.
6. The origin and the growth field: the origin (placed by hand, else the top
   of the paint) is snapped to the refined mesh and the distance from it along
   the mesh is found (Dijkstra over the refined edges, then smoothed). Its
   gradient is the growth direction: which way the runners went.
7. Candidates: points on the refined triangles inside the paint, thousands per
   square metre, with the paint field, the growth distance, the distance in
   from the paint's outline and their gradients.
8. Strata: `sheets` sheets of leaves, 3 cm apart, each laying a share of
   `leaf_fill` times the paint's area in leaves. A leaf is a card lying on
   the hull with its BASE at the candidate and its tip pointing down the growth
   field (away from the origin, strayed by up to `spread`), raised `thickness`
   at the origin and sloping down to the rock at the far end of the carpet,
   and pitched tip-up by `tilt`. Cards near one another share the growth
   direction and the pitch, so they are parallel planes offset along the
   growth: a leaf's tip lies OVER the base of the leaf beyond it and never cuts
   through it. Over `edge_round` in from the paint's outline (a distance
   along the mesh) the carpet's cross-section rounds down onto the rock: every
   sheet's height eases to the underlay's at the outline, and a leaf there is
   laid along that arc - turned with its slope and aimed so its tip lands on
   it - so the mass curves into the stone instead of ending as a shelf.
9. Vines: one per anchor, a 3 mm stem hanging straight down from the anchor,
   held in front of the rock by a ray cast, with ivy leaves alternating sides
   and tapering toward the tip. Nothing places a vine but the artist.
10. Colour: a vertex colour the material multiplies into a white atlas. Three
   green tones patch across the rock by a slow noise, lit toward `light`
   where the hull faces up, darkened and cooled in the lower strata, then a
   small value jitter per leaf so neighbouring blocks differ.
11. Shadow: a second mesh, a decal lying 3 mm off the rock around the paint,
   `shadow_color` at `shadow_strength` under the carpet and fading out over
   `shadow_reach` from the paint's edge - further below it than beside it by
   `shadow_drop`, as a shadow from above falls. The leaves cast real shadows
   too (Blender: visible_shadow; the game: render3d/ivyShadow.ts), but the
   game's sun biases hide a shadow within a few centimetres of the stone, and
   the decal is that near shade. Its alpha is the vertex colour's, so it is
   one blended material with no texture.

Detail "CLUMPS" (for the backdrop) swaps step 8 for _clumps: one sheet of
cards that each carry a clump of leaves, laid the same way; a vine placed by
hand is one strand card (_strand). The rock is refined no finer than CLUMP_RES of a clump, and the
cards index the clump atlas (mesh_io.clump_atlas) instead.

The atlas (mesh_io.atlas) is a 4 x 4 sheet of silhouettes: fifteen ivy leaves,
three- and five-lobed, each drawn a little differently, base at the bottom of
the card and tip at the top, and one faceted round the underlay and the stems
point at, so the whole ivy is one material and one draw.
