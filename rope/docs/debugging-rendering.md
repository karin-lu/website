# Debugging rendering

On Windows, the screenshot runner terminates its own Chrome process tree with
`taskkill /PID ... /T /F`, waits briefly for Chrome to exit, and retries profile
removal. A busy temporary profile produces a warning rather than replacing the
original page error or invalidating a successful capture. Killing only Chrome's
parent left helper processes holding files and caused `EBUSY` during cleanup.
The opt-in [River Dream Loop preview](river-dream-preview.md) uses the same
background selection in playable pages and `shot.html`.

## Normal play and screenshots must read the same level

On 2026-09-28 the river package passed a shot capture while the linked playable
page still showed its old backing wall. The shot carried current level data in
a bundle. Normal play imported the registry's cached JSON: `/api/levels/ball`
contained `backgroundPackage`, while `/levels/ball.json?import` omitted it.
A timestamp query on the JSON import immediately returned the new field.

The level API and its disk watcher already invalidated Vite's cache, but they
passed native Windows paths with backslashes. Vite's module graph uses normalized
paths with forward slashes and does not normalize `getModulesByFile` arguments.
The invalidation found zero modules. `invalidateLevelFile` now normalizes the
lookup for every client/SSR environment; the regression covers those cache keys
and package propagation through normal play and editor test construction.

Check the playable page with `backgroundDiagnostics=1` and its captured console,
as well as bundle screenshots. `window.__background` exposes current status.
The river should report `ready`, two layers and hidden body 205 after warm-up.

The physics loop above has a section of discipline because every rule in it was paid for by a debugging day.
The renderer now has one for the same reason: the 2026-08-04 water sessions violated all six of these, and each cost hours.

- **A headless screenshot without its captured console is not evidence.**
  A three.js shader that fails to compile draws nothing and reports the reason only in the page log, so a grab of it looks like an ordinary picture of a scene with something missing.
  Three separate "works in the headless screenshot, broken live" failures happened in one afternoon that way, and zero THREE warnings were seen across a whole day of renderer work.
  `cli shot` now captures `window.__shotLog` (installed by an inline script in `shot.html`, ahead of the module, so a module that throws while evaluating is caught too), prints every entry as `[page] <level>: ...`, **exits nonzero on any `error`** unless `--allow-errors` is passed, and paints a red banner onto the PNG so the artifact says why it is wrong.
  Shader errors are surfaced synchronously before `shotReady`: `Scene3D`'s diagnostic mode (opt-in, `shotMain` only) sets `checkShaderErrors` and an `onShaderError` reporter, and `compilePrograms()` walks every material's program and asks it for its uniforms - which is the call that actually runs three's link check, since neither `compile()` nor `compileAsync()` does.
  A change to a shader is claimed working only with a clean `[page]` log or a live-browser check.
- **Motion claims need multi-frame evidence.**
  Flashing, flicker, wrong advection speed and anything else that only exists BETWEEN frames are structurally invisible to a single grab, and the user was the only detector for two such bugs across 36 grabs and nine rejection rounds.
  `cli shot bundle --frames A..B --every K [--3d]` replays once, draws a labelled filmstrip and prints the changed-pixel count between adjacent tiles, plus min/median/max.
  A steady flow is a flat series and a flashing artifact is a spike pattern in it; the wall clock is pinned per tile (`pinClock(frame / 60)`) so wall-driven animation advances with the sim rather than with when the command was run.
  Nothing gates on the numbers - this is `--diff` for motion, making the claim cheap to evidence rather than assertable.
  Note the whole frame is measured, so a moving camera swamps a small effect: profile a scene at REST when the thing being measured is the animation itself.
- **No tuning on unmeasured geometry.**
  Sampling density against the highest harmonic, UV anchoring and triangulation shape are checkable numbers, and a morning went into tuning aesthetic constants over geometry whose defects were all three at once.
  Check them before touching a constant; constants tuned against broken geometry are rework, all of them.
- **Prefer the textbook, renderer edition.**
  Before hand-rolling a visual effect, survey what three.js ships and what the established technique is - the same rule the physics side states as "what does Box2D do".
  It cuts both ways: `Water2` was surveyed and correctly rejected, with the reasons written down under [**Water**](water.md), which is worth as much as adopting it would have been.
- **Two rejected aesthetic rounds mean stop.**
  Re-derive the approach and ask for a reference image rather than burning the user as a per-round oracle.
  Nine rounds happened because no rule said stop.
- **Performance claims need real-GPU numbers.**
  Headless chromium runs SwiftShader: the ball arena draws at **4 fps / 250 ms a frame** there and at 60 fps on the 2D path in the same browser, so a frame time measured through `cli shot` is a number about SwiftShader.
  Draw-call and triangle counts ARE transferable and are worth quoting; label them as what they are.
  FPS comes from the live page (below).

## Testing a weaker GPU

A frame time read on the development machine is a number about the development
machine, and the gap to a player's is usually bigger than a tuning pass can
close: this desk has an RTX 4070 SUPER, and a run reported at 10 fps against 144
here is a 14x difference, which is a category difference rather than a
regression.

Three axes reproduce one, and they are worth separating because the HUD already
says which one is biting - a high `gpu` row is fill or the GPU, a high `cpu` row
with a low `gpu` row is the main thread, and `sim` splits the physics out of both.

- **Fill rate: `?dpr=N`.** `fitCanvas` used to size the backing store at the
  window's fit times the display's full DPR with no cap, so a 4K panel drew 8.3
  MP of the same scene where a 1080p desk drew 2.1 MP, and a HiDPI laptop at DPR
  2 drew up to about 14 MP - the same picture, at up to seven times the fragment
  cost, decided entirely by whose display it landed on.
  It is now **capped at the frame's own 1920x1080** (a window smaller than that
  still draws at its own size; nothing supersamples), which makes the renderer's
  fill cost the same number for every player and is the ceiling every other
  reading in this doc should be taken under.
  `?dpr=N` is the escape hatch from the cap, and the way the trade is measured:
  `?dpr=2` on a 1080p display pays exactly what the uncapped 4K path used to.
  Chromium's `--force-device-scale-factor` does NOT do this: it scales CSS pixels
  as well, `window.innerWidth` halves as the DPR doubles, and the backing store
  comes out the same size.
- **The GPU itself: this box has a second one.** Alongside the 4070 is the Ryzen
  iGPU, and a headless chromium given `--use-gl=angle --use-angle=gl-egl` lands
  on it by default (`ANGLE (AMD, AMD Radeon Graphics (radeonsi raphael_mendocino
  ...))`), which is worth knowing because the runner's flag list tries
  `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader --disable-gpu` first and therefore never gets
  there. It is a real driver on real silicon, which SwiftShader is not.
  A headless page still does not run its loop, though - pointed at the live
  server for 14 s it reports `window.__perf` all zeros with `visibilityState`
  `visible` - so this gives a weak GPU to a GRAB, and fps still comes from the
  live page below.
- **No acceleration at all: `--use-gl=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader`.**
  The floor, and a real case rather than a hypothetical: a player whose driver
  Chrome has blocklisted falls back to software, and 10 fps is that class of
  number whatever the level does. Nothing tuned makes it back.
- **The main thread: CDP `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate`.** 4-6x for a low-end
  laptop. It is the right knob only once the `cpu` row says the wall is there.

Before emulating any of it, check what the players actually have. A run streamed
to the store carries `ua`, `device`, `dpr`, `viewport` and `render` (see
[**Production recording**](production-recording.md)) but no GPU string and no frame times, and a
14x gap is large enough that the profile names the cause outright - software
fallback, four times the fragments, or the 2D path - where a week of emulation
only narrows it.

## The live-verification workflow

`cli shot` is the channel for reproducible geometry and shading evidence.
The live browser is the channel for anything SwiftShader cannot represent: frame rate, tuned-constant sign-off, and the page's own console.

1. `cd rope && bun run dev`.
2. Drive Chrome with the claude-in-chrome extension (or a human): navigate to the level, `?hud=1` for the on-screen instruments, `?level=NAME` and `?render=2d|3d` as usual.
   **F3 toggles the panel while playing**, which is the form a human wants: the frames worth looking at are the ones being played, not the ones after a reload with a different URL.
3. Read `window.__perf` by JS evaluation - `{fps, frameMs, frameMsP50, frameMsP99, cpuPct, gpuMs, heapMb, drawCalls, triangles, programs, w5}`, rewritten once a second (`render/perfProbe.ts`).
   The 2D path reports the FPS half and zeros for the rest, since it has no draw calls to speak of.
4. Screenshot on a real GPU, and read the live console.

`?hud=1`/F3 draws exactly those numbers under the FPS counter, so what a human eyeballs and what a script reads cannot disagree.
The probe is render-side, allocated once, and touches no sim state, so it can never reach the fixed step.

**A tab the browser has backgrounded renders nothing.**
`requestAnimationFrame` stops when `document.visibilityState` is `hidden`, and a claude-in-chrome screenshot resumes it for the length of the capture - so the panel a script grabs off an unfocused window is a page starting from cold every time, showing 120 ms frames and near-empty graphs.
Check `document.visibilityState` before believing any live reading, and get the window focused (or ask the user to look) rather than reporting the capture's own stall as the game's frame time.

### What the four rows actually measure

The browser exposes no process CPU and no GPU utilisation, so each row is the honest proxy rather than a task-manager figure, and saying which is which is the difference between an instrument and a decoration:

- **frame** - wall time between rendered frames. The 60 Hz and 30 Hz budgets are the dashed lines on its graph.
- **cpu** - the MAIN THREAD's busy fraction: the previous frame callback's own wall time over the interval it was spent in. 100% means the loop IS the frame; a low number beside a high frame time means the wait is elsewhere (GPU, compositor, vsync).
  Pairing a callback with the `dt` measured *before* it ran reports ratios of two different intervals - it once read 339% - so the loop deliberately reports last frame's cost against this frame's `dt`.
- **gpu** - the GPU's own clock around `renderer.render`, via `EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2` (`render/gpuTimer.ts`). The CPU-side bracket around the same call measures command submission and cannot see a GPU-bound frame at all.
  Queries retire a few frames late and must be polled every frame whether or not a new one is opened; a pool that fills while nothing drains it freezes the reading at its last value for ever, which is what it did.
  Unavailable (and labelled so) on the 2D path and on any driver without the extension.
- **ram** - `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize`, Chromium-only, polled at 4 Hz. **JS objects only**: textures, geometry and the drawing buffers are GPU memory and appear in no browser API.

Each row carries its five-second average and worst alongside a graph of the same window (`render/perfHistory.ts`, 50 buckets of 100 ms; `w5` in the snapshot is the same fold).
The graphs scale to the window's 90th percentile rather than its worst column, so one 250 ms stall does not flatten five seconds of 7 ms frames into a line along the floor - the spike runs off the top, and the exact figure is the `max` on the row above.
Memory is the exception on both counts: it is not zero-based and it is not clipped, because a heap's shape is its reading.

## What a grab is doing under the hood

`cli shot` drives chromium over CDP (`src/tools/shotRunner.ts`, Bun's own `fetch` and `WebSocket`, no dependency) rather than through `--screenshot`.
Three things follow, and each replaced a guess:

- **The grab is gated on `window.shotReady`**, which the page had always set and nothing had ever polled.
  A grab is taken the moment the page says it is done (a 2D frame in ~0.6 s, a dressed 3D one in ~1.3 s) instead of when a 20 s virtual-time budget expires.
  A page that never becomes ready fails the command inside the wall-clock timeout (`--timeout`, 30 s) with its partial log printed, rather than stalling.
- **`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` plus a clip** fix the viewport at the game's own 1920x1080 frame.
  That retired the "headless chromium keeps 87px of the window" hack, which never worked: every grab carried an 87px letterbox band along the bottom.
  The frame's pixels are unchanged - a clean-tree grab diffs to 0 against the old runner's top 1080 rows.
- **Virtual time is gone**, and the wall-clock timeout is the only ceiling.
  `Emulation.setVirtualTimePolicy` used to bracket the navigation so the page's clocks ran as fast as its work allowed. What it also does, on chromium 142, is stop OFF-MAIN-THREAD IMAGE DECODING from ever completing: `createImageBitmap` of a JPEG or a WebP returns a promise that never settles, while PNG - decoded on the main thread - is unaffected.
  That is every 3D grab in the project, because `assets:optimize` puts every prop's textures through `--texture-compress webp` and `GLTFLoader` takes the `ImageBitmapLoader` path whenever `createImageBitmap` exists: the mesh promise never resolves, `assetsSettled` never returns, and every scene at once fails with `still waiting for assets: mesh "..."` - which reads as the renderer being broken rather than as an emulation setting.
  The grab does not need it. What makes a picture reproducible is that the page pins its own clock (`Scene3D.pinClock`), waits for every asset before it draws, and is polled on `shotReady` rather than on elapsed time, so the frame is the same frame whether the wall took 1 s or 5; virtual time was only buying speed.
  For the same reason the page does not give up on its assets by its own clock; it names what it is still waiting for (`still waiting for assets: mesh "sewer-arch"`) and the harness's wall clock is what fails the run.

`shotMain` also reports a **blank 3D frame** as an error (`Scene3D.litFraction()`, read off the drawing buffer), since an empty frame is a valid PNG that every other view calls healthy.
The historical late-frame blank flake did not reproduce in 20 consecutive gated runs at `--frame 40`, nor under the old runner, so its cause is still unidentified; what exists now is the detector, which is the half that makes the next occurrence loud instead of silent.

## A mid-play stutter is usually a program compiled on first sight

three compiles a material's program, and uploads its textures, the first time a mesh wearing them is DRAWN - inside the frustum, in `renderer.render` - not when the material is made or the level built.
The warm frame (see [loading-screen](loading-screen.md)) draws from the spawn camera, so a material combination that nothing near the spawn uses is compiled the first time the player scrolls it into view, in the middle of a run.

`session-1697f` (2026-09-14) is the measured case: a hitch about 1.7 s before the bundle was saved.
The DevTools trace showed a 15 ms `frame` callback at a steady 144 Hz cadence of 1-2 ms frames, and inside it the CPU profile was three's `WebGLProgram` → `getProgramInfoLog` (the link-status wait, ~7 ms) and `texSubImage2D` (~4 ms); the GPU process then ran one 45 ms task where every other in the trace was under 1 ms, the compositor dropped four frames (`STATE_DROPPED`), and the next rAF came 35 ms late.
`shot --probe` over the bundle named it: at the frame the lantern under the ledge (`lantern-rusty`, body 37) entered the frustum, programs went 11 → 12 and textures 26 → 30 - the scene's ONLY material with an `emissiveMap`, compiled there with its four maps uploaded.
Nothing physics-side happened on that frame; the hook throw seven frames earlier was a coincidence of where the player was looking (the headless replay, at its own 1920x1080 frustum, reaches the lantern 20 frames sooner, before the throw).

How much of it a session can meet is bounded, and `--probe all` measures the bound: it compiles the whole scene after the warm frame and names what the warm frame missed.
On BALL that is two materials (the two emissive lamps, `lantern-rusty` and `bulkhead-lamp`), plus the chain's `InstancedMesh` program and its shadow variant on the FIRST THROW of every session (an 11 ms frame at 0.75 s in the same trace, `getProgramInfoLog` again), plus 35 of 55 texture sources, which upload three at a time as each surface set is first seen (about 4 ms each; two such events in 1697f, none of which dropped a frame at 144 Hz).
Every one of them fires once per session and never twice in the same place; a stutter that repeats where the player already was is a different class.

How to see it: record a bundle, then `cli shot <bundle> --frames 1..N --every 40 --3d --probe`.
Run probes one at a time: four in parallel on SwiftShader took 20-25 s each instead of 8 and reported no uploads at all, which the same bundles alone contradict.
It skips the precompile a grab normally does (which would answer "the warm frame" for everything) and logs `probe {frame, programs, textures, fresh}` per drawn frame, `fresh` naming each mesh whose program is new since the previous probe, by program, material maps, world position and parent chain.
On a level with waking lights the line also carries `glow`, each waking light's level in authored order (see [Waking lights](lighting-and-surfaces.md#waking-lights)).
Narrow with a smaller `--every` once the jump is bracketed.
A texture-count jump without a program jump is the same class one size smaller: a surface set first seen (three textures) uploads without a compile.

The loading-screen doc records that compiling every program up front took nothing off the FIRST frame; that was a different question.
This is the cost that precompile does remove, and since 2026-09-14 `Scene3D.prewarm` removes it under the loading screen (see [loading-screen](loading-screen.md)): every material's program, one stand-in per shadow-pass variant, every texture, every geometry.
The stand-ins are the part worth knowing: the shadow pass wears three's own depth and distance materials, reconfigured per caster (side flipped, the caster's map and alpha test carried over) and keyed per object (instancing, instance colour) - and `fog` is in every program's key whether the material uses it or not, so the stand-ins compile with the scene's fog off, as the shadow pass does.
Verified with `--probe all` over 1697f and 2177f: 13 programs and 55 textures after the prewarm, `pending` 0, and nothing fresh on any frame of either replay - where the lazy runs had compiled two shadow variants on frame 1, the chain's on the first throw and the lantern's on sight.
