// The SOURCES of the Blender scenes: the `.blend` files under `assets-src/`
// and the pictures their tools paint with. The game never loads one - it loads
// the exported `scene.glb` (`scripts/publish-scenes.ts`) - but a scene's
// `.blend` is the only copy of how its dressing was made, and before these
// were pinned it was lost with the machine that made it.
//
// They live in the same release store as every other binary, and for the same
// reason (docs/asset-store.md: deletable, never in git history), under a name
// of their own - `source-<path with "/" as "-">` - and are REPLACED IN PLACE on
// publish, as scenes are: a source is saved again and again while it is
// worked on, and a name per save would keep every draft for ever. The pin in
// `scripts/sceneSources.json` (sha256 + bytes, keyed by the path under
// `assets-src/`) is what says which save a commit meant.
//
//   bun run assets:publish-sources [path ...]   (part of `just publish`)
//   bun run assets:fetch-sources                (`just sources`)
//
// The build does not fetch them: a deploy draws exports, never sources, and a
// scene's `.blend` is tens of megabytes it has no use for.
